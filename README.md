Module Three Project Log Q&A:

- How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
  - Playtest: Alpha Release
    - The alpha release will contain the basic level design of the game. Testing will include player, enemy, and weapon functionality along with basic concepts of menu designs along with preliminary win/lose conditions. Alpha Release will also introduce the first two enemies into the game, so testing will be done on the enemy AI as well. See QA schedule for full log of deliverables and QA test plan for individual testing components prior to Alpha release. 
  - Demo: Beta
    - The beta release will contain all the content of the alpha release in addition to an additional room, additional enemy AI, full textured environment with sound, and a minimap system. The additional enemy AI will spawn additional viruses. The QA testing plan will also include the testing of functionality on the spawner viruses along with a textured environment with sound. See QA schedule for full log of deliverables and QA test plan for individual testing components prior to Beta Release.
  - Code Release: Final Release
    - The final release will be the polished version of the game. All concepts will be functions should be bug free and a full regression testing will be down. See QA schedule for full log of deliverables and QA test plan for individual testing components prior to Final release. 

- What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
  - See QA test plan for individual test plan for each iteration stage of development. 

- How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
  - The test plan will be updated each week during the weekly team meeting. This will allow the team to align to test plans and move forward. Tests are set to be conducted on the weekends allowing the design team to still make improvements through the week. 

- How will bugs be reported?
  - Bugs will be noted on the QA test plan. Any ongoing bugs that cannot be resolved immediately will be added to the Trello board as an ongoing bug.

- How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
  - Ongoing bugs will be discuss by the team on a weekly basis. Bugs will be addressed by the severity of the bug.

Module Four Project Log:

- What parts of the testing process did the team perceive to go well?
  - The team perceived the testing of the core gameplay mechanics to go well. Since several team members had prior experience with player character and enemy AI design, including behavior trees, this allowed us to build and test these systems with greater efficiency. We were able to run early playtests to validate movement, combat interactions, and basic AI behavior, leading to fewer major issues during the later stages of development. Familiarity with these systems meant bugs were quickly identified and resolved, allowing for a smoother gameplay experience early in the Alpha phase. Please view the QA Testing Plan v1.1 (Alpha Test Plan Sheet) for testing results. 

- How were bugs identified and corrected?
  - Bugs were primarily identified through iterative testing within each developer's individual branch before merging into the main build. This allowed team members to isolate and catch issues early during development. If a conflict or bug arose during the merge process, it was communicated promptly via Discord, where the team collaborated to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. This approach encouraged real-time problem solving and helped prevent major bugs from making it into the main branch.

- In terms of the QA and testing process, what would you do differently to improve the process?
  - The team would have allocated more time specifically for playtesting the level. One major issue encountered was a problem loading the in-game level map, which resulted from a merge conflict. This unexpected setback delayed testing and required the team to hop on a group call to troubleshoot and resolve the issue collaboratively. By planning more time for integration testing and level playthroughs earlier in the development timeline, the team could have caught these issues sooner and ensured smoother progression into the Alpha build.

- What tools (chosen in Module Two) did you find successful in the development of your Alpha Project? Why?
  - The tools chosen in Module Two ,discord, Trello, and weekly team meetings—were, highly effective during the Alpha Project. Discord played a crucial role in maintaining open and immediate communication, allowing the team to quickly report bugs, coordinate tasks, and share updates in real time. Weekly meetings provided structured checkpoints to assess progress and align on priorities. Additionally, Trello helped organize tasks, track development milestones, and assign responsibilities, which kept the team focused and on schedule.

- Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
  - So far, all the tools introduced to the team have provided value in one way or another. Trello, Discord, and weekly meetings worked well together as a balanced system for organization, task management, and open communication. Each tool served a specific purpose; Trello for tracking progress, Discord for real-time collaboration, and weekly meetings for structured planning and accountability. 

- How did the team approach to the initial analysis of the game design document contribute to the decision to use these tools and techniques?
  - During the initial analysis of the game development, the team identified key areas that would require consistent communication, organized task tracking, and regular collaboration—especially around gameplay systems, level design, and AI behavior. This led to the decision to use Discord for real-time discussions and quick updates, Trello for managing tasks and monitoring development progress, and weekly meetings to review milestones and clarify any uncertainties in the GDD. The structured breakdown of the GDD helped the team assign roles and responsibilities effectively, making these tools essential in keeping the project aligned with the original design vision.

Module Four Team Journal:

July Wellman - Team Lead
  - The team got together over the weekend to do testing on the game. The team lead worked on the QA test plan and compiling all the results of the tests from the team into the Alpha test plan that was performed in our meeting. The lead also worked on creating the module four readme and the team journals from everyone’s reports. 

Sarah Elizaldi - Artist
  - The artist focused on polishing the final polish of the main assets, rigging and animations. All enemies are going the finishing stages of rigging and animation. The artist also finished the design of the main character and rig. Main character will still need animations. The artist also completed the base texture for the level design. 

Ryan Trinh - Programmer
  - The programmer worked on the sounds for the gun animations including shooting and reloading. Sounds were also added in for the pickups when the player walks through the pickup item. Created and programmed the speed, ammo, and health pick up using placeholders. Created the initial elevator and the landing sound for the elevators that are going up and down. The programmer formatted the build environment and packed the final Alpha build. 

Travis Woolston - UI/UX
  - The UI/UX developer worked on creating the Player HUB, enemy behavior and animation integration. The player HUD consisted of the reticle, ammo counter, and health bar. The enemy behavior included the parasite, spider, and spawner enemy. The animation integration includes the rotating gun magazine, parasite, spider, and spawner behavioral AI.

Ethan Lozano - Level Designer
  - The level designer worked on the level layout concept and the level blockout. The level designer finished the calls, ceiling, and tubes. The tubes will be used as tunnels for intestines. The level designer also worked on the lighting throughout the level to add ambiance to the level theme.

Module Five Project Log:
- What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go well in relation to the last stage evaluation?
  - The team expected the asset creation, textures, and functionality of the level design to go well since they did not run into any major bugs in the Alpha build. Many of the bugs in the Alpha build was retested to make sure everything functioned correctly. The team also anticipated the additional elements like the elevators, pickups, and virus reproduction to go well. Assets were created and added to the Beta build stage for the pickups and elevators with no bugs. All of the functions performed as intended during the Beta test. See QA Testing Plan v1.2(Beta Testing Plan Sheet for functional testing).

- What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go wrong in relation to the last stage evaluation?
  - The team perceive asset animation to be slow since they experienced this problem in Alpha stage. The team is still getting pointer errors in git bash when committing the block out map, but the team has been able to resolve when merging. The team also anticipated merge conflicts among the group.

- How were the previous evaluations integrated into this latest stage?
  - In the Alpha stage, the team experienced many merge conflicts. The evaluations from the last stage helped the team refined how they approached the Beta build. For example, some of the developers had a backup map to load in if the block out map was not functioning to recover a working state. The team stayed vigilant on reporting merge conflicts to Discord and resolving the issue as it occurred instead of letting the bugs build over time. Other previous evaluations integrated into the Beta Stage was the QA test plan for game functionality. See the Beta Test Plan Sheet for all functions that were testing prior to Beta release.

- What would you do differently to improve the collaboration or development process?
  - To improve the collaboration or development process, the team could arrange better times to collaborate. Due to the team working remotely, the team often struggled to find the time to meet every week, letting everyone be in the same room. On top of school, work, and home lives, it has been fairly difficult to arrange a concrete time where everyone can be available. The team has done well in reporting to Discord updates and problems, but that is a lot of material if you are not actively on discord to keep up with development. 

- Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
  - The team found Trello to not be helpful in the process. There were too many outlets to report tasks to, and the team ended up just using discord for all of their reporting. The other side of this is that the information is not organized in Discord, so it was difficult to gauge progress if you were not actively in the chat.

- Identify the completed stage of development of the intended beta and address the project schedule to meet Final Release development deadline.
  - The completed beta stage includes a playable game where the player starts in a room and must follow the path to reach a platform to win the game. The level design consists of five textured rooms with three enemy types including spiders, worms, and spawners. The objective of the game is to defeat the spawners in each room to open up the next area until you get to the end. The theme of the game is a virus hunting simulator where the player is tasks with dealing with viruses inside a body. The level designs include two elevators that go up and down, a radar enemy detection map, and spawners that will spawn additional enemies. The level also includes various pickups consisting of health, ammo, and speed boosts. The final release will contain the last deliverable, two elevators moving from side to side. Full regression testing will also be applied to the project before release on 8/10/25. The team has completed all of the deliverables except the elevators moving side to side. The week of Final release will be focused additional level design and working out any bugs that may exist in the game, which up to this point has been minimal since the team has been debugging their own branches before push.

Module Five Team Journal:

July Wellman - Team Lead
  - The team lead tested the Final Beta build branch and filled out the Beta Test Plan. Functionality and QA testing were performed prior to the release of Beta build to ensure all objects functioned as intended. The team lead also worked compiling all the data from the week to create the Module Five Project log and team journals.

Sarah Elizaldi - Artist
  - The artist focused on level layouts, building environmental assets, and preparing them for engine usage. This included establishing collisions, lighting, materials and replacement of place holder assets. Level layout work includes laying the foundation for arena locations, making the assets make sense where placed and designing a flow in each room that allows for an unrestricted environment for the player.

Ryan Trinh - Programmer
  - The programmer worked on enhancing the game’s audio and interactivity. Additions included: adding dynamic footstep sounds for the player and integrating them with the speed pickup so the playback rate adjusts based on movement speed, updating the jump landing sound, background music to both the game and main menu, and implemented button hover and click sounds to improve UI feedback. Additionally, the programmer also created a wall that disappears when the spawner dies, adding a responsive mechanic to the level that prevents players from skipping past the intended encounter.

Travis Woolston - UI/UX
  - The UI/UX improved AI navigational and mechanical logic by syncing spawn time with spawner animation, and updated spider enemy behavior to be more interactive. Additions include adding enemy health bars to the parasite and spawner blueprints, as well as added an explosive fracture effect to Spawners that triggers on death. The UI/UX designer also created a radar (mini map) that uses a 2D render target to display enemy locations to the player along with improved projectile logic with a slight aim assist to make projectiles snappier while maintaining physics simulation. The UI/UX also packaged the final beta build. 

Ethan Lozano - Level Designer
  - The level designer worked on creating assets alongside the artist for the arenas, and the intestines. The designer gave insight to the artist on what needed to be created whilst making his own assets, to which the artist took over and refined. The level designer and the artists populated the first and second arena, as well as having the intestines be more detailed and having existing assets refined for the level theme. Most of the assets needed for the final build are ready, and at this point require refinement and placement, the rest of the level however is put together thanks to the combined efforts of the entire team, with proper asset placement and refinement.

Module Six Project Log:

- What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go well in relation to the last stage evaluation?
  - The team felt that the overall game functionality went well, as the final stages primarily focused on creating additional assets and refining menu buttons. Most core functions had already been implemented in the beta release, so this stage involved re-testing functionality and ensuring QA standards were met for all five fully textured rooms. A full regression test was completed for the final release. (See QA Testing Plan - Final Test Plan sheet for functional testing and results.)

- What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go wrong in relation to the last stage evaluation?
  - The team continued to experience GitHub merge conflicts, especially when pushing map updates. However, these issues were addressed promptly, and the team remained vigilant in bug reporting to prevent problems from piling up. This proactive approach allowed development to progress smoothly despite the setbacks.

- How were the previous evaluations integrated into this latest stage?
  - One key issue from the beta release was the main menu settings button not functioning correctly. This was resolved by the UI/UX programmer, who implemented the necessary functionality in this stage. Additionally, the final deliverable, adding elevators that moved side-to-side, was completed for the final release, ensuring all project requirements were met.
    
- What would you do differently to improve the collaboration or development process?
  - Scheduling and coordinating meeting times proved to be the team’s biggest challenge. While availability varied, the team worked well together when gathering resources and finalizing project components. Discord served as the primary communication tool, which was particularly helpful for members who could not engage throughout the day.
 
- Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
  - The Trello board was initially helpful for aligning on scope and tracking tasks, but over time it fell into inactivity. The team did not observe a drop in efficiency without it, so the decision was made to discontinue its use and focus communication exclusively through Discord.
    
Module Six Team Journal:

July Wellman - Team Lead
  - The team lead worked on testing the final release of the game compiling and drawing up the results of the final test plan in the QA testing plan document. The team lead also updated the GitHub Readme with the module six project log and team journals.
    
Sarah Elizaldi - Artist
  - The artist focused on finishing asset creation with animations and creating animation for the main character. Also focused on lighting set ups that work with lumen when baked down.
    
Ryan Trinh - Programmer
  - The programmer added a magazine reload sound, created credits and a “How to Play” guide in the main menu, and fixed a bug with the horizontal elevator. I also designed an overdrive pickup, gave enemies unique death sounds, and added ambient audio to the lung and heart areas in the level for more immersive gameplay.
    
Travis Woolston - UI/UX
  - The UI/UX developer integrated the player character animations, reload and idle. Integrated new level design with game logic, rigged spawners to doors, added audio volumes for reverb. The developer also continued to work on the radar, the intention is that spawner dots will be bigger (though there are still inconsistencies to look into.) Other minor QoL improvements documented in commits. The developer also packaged the final release of the game. 
    
Ethan Lozano - Level Designer
  - The level designer worked with the artist to refine the five rooms and add additional assets to fully textured environments.
