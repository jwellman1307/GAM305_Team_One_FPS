  -Arena shooter featuring player seeking and destroying enemies on the board. 
  -Enemies will consist of virus themed creatures. 
  -Player will use a gun to shoot syringe ammo into enemies. 
  -Player can use the elevator to get to different floors of the game level
  -Player can pick up pill bottles to restore health or other objects for stamina
  -certain enemy types can reproduce smaller enemies targeting the player on the level

-Create a schedule or timeline for developing your game based on due dates outlined within the course.
  -Gantt Chart v1.1

-Determine the development goals for the Alpha and Beta Stage submissions (which assets/elements should be in place and what level of functionality you are going to use to track the project progress in the Alpha and Beta stages).
  -QA Testing Schedule

-Choose preferred communication method(s).
  -Discord

-Choose the frequency of communication (team meeting).
  -Discord weekly meetings
    -Saturdays 4-5pm

Module Three Project Log:

-How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
  -Playtest: Alpha Release
    -The alpha release will contain the basic level design of the game. Testing will include player, enemy, and weapon functionality along with basic concepts of menu designs along with preliminary win/lose conditions. Alpha Release will also introduce the frist two enemies into the game, so testing will be done on the enemy AI as well. See QA schedule for full log of deliverables and QA test plan for individual testing components prior to Alpha release. 
  -Demo: Beta
    -The beta release will contain all the content of the alpha release in addition to an additional room, addiitonal enemy AI, full textured environment with sound, and a minimap system. The additional enemy AI will spawn additional viruses. The QA testing plan will also include the testing of functionality on the spawner viruses along with a textured environment with sound. See QA schedule for full log of deliverables and QA test plan for individual testing components prior to Beta Release.
  -Code Release: Final Release
    -The final release will be the polished version of the game. All concepts will be functions should be bug free and a full regression testing will be down. See QA schedule for full log of deliverables and QA test plan for individual testing components prior to Final release. 

-What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
  -See QA test plan for individual test plan for each iteration stage of development. 

-How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
  -The test plan will be updated each week during the weekly team meeting. This will allow the team to align to test plans and move forward. Tests are set to be conducted on the weekends allowing the design team to still make improvements through the week. 

-How will bugs be reported?
  -Bugs will be noted on the QA test plan. Any ongoing bugs that cannot be resolved immediately will be added to the trello board as an ongoing bug.

-How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
  -Ongoing bugs will be discuss by the team on a weekly basis. Bugs will be addressed by the severity of the bug.
